1. ##### Tool Palette

   - **Selection tool**: clicking on this tool allows user to click on a drawn shape to select, during which the properties will immediately reflect this selected shapeâ€™s properties. A selected item can be dragged in the bound of current canvas and user can change its properties by changing the these on the tool bar. When a item is selected, clicking on **key ESC** or clicking on an empty party of the canvas will deselect this item; clicking **delete key**, in the other case, will delete this selected item. Also user can cut and copy an selected shape by using the edit menubar.
   - **Erase tool**: clicking on this tool allows user to erase an drawn shape by then simply clicking on that shape.
   - **Line drawing tool**: clicking on this tool allows the user draw a line with the selected properties (all properties must be selected to draw a line), where the first mouse press sets the start point and then the mouse release point after dragging sets the end point of the line.
   - **Circle drawing tool**: clicking on this tool allows the user to draw a circle with the selected properties, where first mouse press the circle center and the mouse release after dragging sets the distance between press and release as the radius of the circle.
